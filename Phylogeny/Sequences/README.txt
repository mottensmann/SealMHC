PBRs:	DQB 13 PBRs (9, 11, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 38, 47, 56, 60, 61, 65) == > 39 bp alignment 
		DRB 16 PBRs (9, 11, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 38, 47, 56, 60, 61, 65, 68, 70, 71) == > 48 bp alignment

In most sequences alignments only ArGa sequences that are well supported are considered (i.e. putatitive alleles),
whereas, drb_arctocephalus & dqb_arctocephalus contain putatitive artefacts as well for genotype based distance
calculations.
