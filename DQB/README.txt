* Near-full-length sequences of Zaca DQB exhibit major problems. Alleles 08-11 are highlighted as pseudogenes in Bowen et alignment,
  whereas only 07 & 08 are listed as such on genbank. Additionally 06 shows significant gaps within exon2 and appears to be unlikely
  functional. Allele 06 is shorter than others by approx 300 bp and shows unusual motifs within exon2.

* M. schauinslandi sequences were submitted to genbank in 2000 (Armstrong), but without accompanying paper. Therefore excluded
AY007203.1
AY007204.1

* After muscle alignment, sequences have been trimmed to 270bp, the entire second exon in arctos thibetanus, 
* Reading frame starts at third position and results in 90 amino acids
