# `SealMHC`

**Major histocompatibility complex characterisation in Antarctic fur seals** 
_(MasterÂ´s project)_

### Documentation
All analyses in processing steps are documented in _Rmarkdown_ files that can be found at the top level of this repository

### Dependencies

Analyses make use of both `R` and `Python` scripts.
In order to to repeat the clustering of Illumina MiSeq reads the pipeline [mhc_cluster](https://github.com/mottensmann/mhc_cluster/) needs to be set up as well.

### Raw data

*File sizes of raw sequence data are too large to integrate them within this repository*
